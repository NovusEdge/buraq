Buraq:
    A command-line utility for bruteforcing ssh

USAGE:
    buraq [command] [options] target

COMMANDS:
    help                Prints this menu if no further option is provided. This
                        can be used in conjunction with other command names to
                        print a more comprehensive guide for usage of said command.
                        For example:
                            buraq help check
                        This will print out information about the check command.

    version             Prints the version of buraq in use.
    env                 Prints the environment variables used by the CLI.
                        These are stored (by default) in ~/.buraq

    attack              Perform a bruteforce attack on specified target using
                        a user/userlist and a password list.
                        If no user is specified, "root" is used.
                        If no password list is used, "~/.buraq/passlist.txt" is used.

    clean               Clear all binaries for the CLI.
    repair              Clear and rebuild all binaries for the CLI.`
